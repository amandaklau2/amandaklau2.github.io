<h1> History of the Web<h1>
<p>Something I found interesting from the first video was ARPANET. ARPANET stands
for “Advanced Research Projects Agency Network”. It started as wanting to make a
communication system that could share information over great distances. Paul Baran was
trying to figure out how to build a communications system that could survive a nuclear
attack. His idea was to break up information. At first, the Baran’s idea was ignored, it was
rediscovered by ARPA. His idea became a key component in ARPANET. ARPANET was
further adapted and fixed as it would be used for both military and civil use.</p>

<p>Something I found interesting from the second and third video where the submarine
cables. There are 420 submarine cables that over 99% of all international traffic is routed
through. These cables use fiber-optic technology which is high-speed data transmission.
This data is transmitted through light using plastic or glass wire. The cables have many
layers and most of them are for protection. These are made to be on the seafloor and are to
withstand any problems that may occur</p>
